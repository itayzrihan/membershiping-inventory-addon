6. Save the product
7. To test awarding:
   - Make a test purchase of the product
   - Check the user's inventory after purchase completion
   - Items and currencies should be automatically awarded

### Testing Content Restrictions

3. Enable content restrictions
4. Configure requirements:
   - Choose restriction type (all/any requirements)

9. Should see full content

### Testing Shortcodes
Use these shortcodes in post content:

```
// Conditional content based on item ownership
[membershiping_require_item item_id="1" quantity="1"]
This content only shows if user owns the specified item.
[/membershiping_require_item]

// Conditional content based on currency
[membershiping_if_has_currency currency_id="1" amount="100"]
This content only shows if user has enough currency.
[/membershiping_if_has_currency]

// Show restriction message for specific content
[membershiping_restriction_message post_id="123"]
```
