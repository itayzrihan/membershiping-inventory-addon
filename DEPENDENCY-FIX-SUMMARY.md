# Dependency Detection Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: Membershiping Inventory plugin was showing error "Membershiping Inventory & Trading System requires Membershiping Core and WooCommerce to be active" even when the core plugin was installed.

## Root Cause
The dependency check was looking for class `Membershiping_Main` but the actual Membershiping Core plugin uses class `Membershiping`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Class Name Detection
- **Before**: `class_exists('Membershiping_Main')`
- **After**: `class_exists('Membershiping')`

### 2. Enhanced Detection Methods
Added multiple fallback detection methods:
- Class existence check
- Plugin active status check
- Constants check (`MEMBERSHIPING_VERSION`)
- Function existence check (`membershiping_get_user_flags`)

### 3. Improved Plugin Loading
- Changed hook priority from 10 to 15 for dependency checks
- Added separate initialization hook at priority 20
- Ensures other plugins load before dependency validation

### 4. Graceful Error Handling
- **Before**: `wp_die()` on activation (kills plugin completely)
- **After**: Shows admin notice and allows plugin to continue with limited functionality

### 5. Activation Warning System
- Added transient-based warning system for activation issues
- Shows warning notices in admin instead of fatal errors
- Allows plugin installation even if dependencies aren't immediately available

## Files Modified

1. **membershiping-inventory.php**
   - Fixed main dependency check logic
   - Added multiple detection methods
   - Improved error handling

2. **includes/class-flag-awards.php**
   - Fixed class name from `Membershiping_Main` to `Membershiping`

## Current Behavior

### When Dependencies Are Missing:
- ‚úÖ Plugin activates successfully (no fatal errors)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Shows admin notice about missing dependencies
- üîí Core functionality disabled until dependencies are met
- üìã Database tables still created for future use

### When Dependencies Are Present:
- ‚úÖ Plugin works normally
- ‚úÖ All features available
- ‚úÖ Full integration with Membershiping Core

## Testing Results
- ‚úÖ PHP syntax validation passed
- ‚úÖ Dependency detection logic verified
- ‚úÖ Multiple fallback methods implemented
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling confirmed
- ‚úÖ No more fatal activation errors

## Next Steps for Users

1. **Install Membershiping Core**: Ensure the main Membershiping plugin is installed and activated
2. **Install WooCommerce**: Ensure WooCommerce is installed and activated  
3. **Check Plugin Order**: Make sure plugins load in correct order
4. **Verify Activation**: Check admin notices for any remaining issues

The plugin will now provide clear feedback about missing dependencies without crashing the site.
